- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Henriksen
- 👀 I have a general interest in most sports, but mainly football. I also have an utmost interest in gaming, that sparked my passion to code.
- 🌱 I`ve have just finished my 2 years at Noroff finishing my degree in Frontend development, my strengths in coding is React and styled components.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use React.js as that is what I want to learn about the most, have experience with Bootstrap and Sass aswell. I am a quick learner though, so if its something similar to these I can take a crack at it.
