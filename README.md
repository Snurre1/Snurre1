- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Henriksen
- 👀 I have a general interest in most sports, but mainly football. I also have an utmost interest in gaming, that sparked my passion to code.
- 🌱 I`ve gone through a year at Noroff where I`ve learned HTML, CSS and JS. I feel confident in HTML and CSS, and still have some learning to do with JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that mainly contain HTML, CSS and JS, I am a quick learner though, so if its something similar to these I can take a crack at it.
